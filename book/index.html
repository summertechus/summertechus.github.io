            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Summer.</p>
            <p>I am not a native English speaker, and I didn't start learning programming until I was 18, when I went to university. Before that, I was a social science student. Like many beginners, I struggled — not because coding itself was too hard, but because the way programming was usually taught felt cold, intimidating, and unnecessarily complicated.</p>
            <p>Most books I encountered were full of technical jargon, examples that seemed disconnected from reality, and a tone that made me feel like I wasn't "cut out" for this world. I often found myself thinking, "Maybe programming just isn't for people like me."</p>
            <p>But here's the truth I discovered much later: programming is for everyone who wants to learn it. The barrier isn't intelligence or talent — it's finding materials that speak your language and meet you where you are.</p>
            <p>I wrote this book because I want to change that experience. This is the book I wish I had when I started.</p>

            <h2>What This Book Is (And Isn't)</h2>
            <p>This is a gentle, approachable introduction to Java for absolute beginners. You don't need any programming experience — just curiosity and willingness to practice.</p>
            
            <h3>This book will:</h3>
            <div class="page-break">===== Page 2 =====</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain concepts in plain, human language</li>
                <li>Show realistic, practical examples</li>
                <li>Introduce small, manageable exercises to build confidence</li>
                <li>Translate computer science jargon into words that make sense</li>
                <li>Acknowledge the struggles and frustrations that come with learning something new</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>This book will not:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Assume you already know technical terms</li>
                <li>Rush through important concepts</li>
                <li>Make you feel inadequate for asking "basic" questions</li>
                <li>Pretend that programming is easy or magical</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h2>How to Learn Without Burning Out</h2>
            <p>Before we begin, let me share a few mindset shifts that helped me survive (and eventually thrive) as a beginner:</p>
            
            <h3>1. The 20-Minute Rule</h3>
            <p>If you're stuck on a problem for 20 minutes, take a break. Walk away. Get water. The solution often appears when you're not staring at the screen. Programming is as much about stepping back as it is about pushing forward.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Practice > Perfection</h3>
            <p>Don't try to write perfect code on your first try. Don't try to memorize every rule. Your goal sequence should be:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make it work</li>
                <li>Make it clear</li>
                <li>Make it efficient</li>
                <li>Make it elegant</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Most of programming happens between steps 1 and 2.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Embrace Google (It's Not Cheating)</h3>
            <p>Searching for solutions is a core programming skill.</p>
            
            <div class="page-break">===== Page 3 =====</div>
            
            <h3>4. Bugs Are Conversations</h3>
            <p>When your code has a bug, the computer is telling you: "I don't understand this instruction." Your job is to clarify. This is a dialogue, not a test of your worth.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Progress Over Speed</h3>
            <p>Learning to code is not a race. Some concepts will click immediately; others might take days or weeks to truly understand. That's normal. Be patient with your own learning rhythm.</p>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h2>Who This Book Is For</h2>
            <p>This book is especially for you if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You've never written code before</li>
                <li>You've tried learning programming but got stuck on technical details</li>
                <li>You want to understand how Java works, not just copy examples</li>
                <li>You learn best with explanations, not just commands</li>
                <li>You believe that struggling is part of learning, not a sign of failure</li>
                <li>You're willing to be patient with yourself</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h2>What You'll Find in These Pages</h2>
            <p>We'll start from absolute zero. I won't assume you know what a "variable" is or what "syntax" means. We'll build your understanding piece by piece:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Part 1</strong> helps you get comfortable with the idea of coding itself - what it means to give instructions to a computer.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="page-break">===== Page 4 =====</div>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Part 2</strong> introduces Java's basic building blocks, with plenty of hands-on practice.</li>
                <li><strong>Part 3</strong> shows how to make decisions and repeat actions — giving your programs real logic.</li>
                <li><strong>Part 4</strong> brings everything together to build small, complete programs.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Throughout the book, you'll find:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plain-language explanations of technical concepts</li>
                <li>Real-world analogies that make abstract ideas concrete</li>
                <li>Small exercises to build muscle memory</li>
                <li>"On Purpose" experiments where we break things to understand them better</li>
                <li>Gentle reminders when things get challenging</li>
                <li>Q&A corners answering questions beginners actually ask</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h2>A Note on Fear</h2>
            <p>If you feel nervous starting this journey, that's completely normal. I felt it too. Every programmer you admire felt it when they began.</p>
            <p>Programming can feel intimidating because it requires a different kind of thinking — precise, literal, step-by-step thinking. But here's the secret: that kind of thinking is a skill, not a talent. And like any skill, it can be learned.</p>
            <p>The discomfort you might feel at first doesn't mean you're bad at this. It means your brain is learning to communicate in a new way. That takes time. And it's worth it.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h2>Let's Begin Together</h2>
            <p>My deepest hope for this book is simple: I want you to finish it feeling that programming is approachable, understandable, and</p>
            
            <div class="page-break">===== Page 5 =====</div>
            
            <p>maybe even enjoyable. I want you to see errors not as failures, but as clues. I want you to feel capable of continuing your learning journey without fear.</p>
            <p>You can learn to code. You can understand Java. And you don't have to do it alone.</p>
            <p>Let's start this journey together — one clear instruction at a time.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 1 — What Does It Mean to "Write Code"? Who Is the Program For?</h3>
                <p>When people say "learning to code," it often sounds mysterious. It feels like you're about to step into a secret world — one filled with strange words, black screens, and people who type incredibly fast while rarely explaining what they're doing.</p>
                <p>Before we talk about Java, syntax, or tools, let's slow down and ask a very simple question:</p>
                <p>What does it actually mean to write code?</p>
                <p>At its core, writing code is not about being clever. It's not about math tricks or memorizing commands. Writing code is simply giving instructions. Very boring instructions. Very literal instructions.</p>
                
                <h4>Code Is Not Magic</h4>
                <div class="page-break">===== Page 6 =====</div>
                <p>A computer does not understand things the way humans do. It doesn't guess what you mean. It doesn't fill in the gaps. It doesn't think, "I get the idea." If an instruction is unclear, the computer does not politely ask for clarification. It simply stops.</p>
                <p>This is why coding often feels frustrating at first. Not because it's hard — but because it's unforgiving.</p>
                <p>When humans communicate, we rely heavily on context: "Put it over there." "Do the usual thing." "You know what I mean."</p>
                <p>Computers don't know what you mean. They only know exact instructions, written in a language they can process. That language is called a programming language. Java is one of them.</p>

                <h3>When Things Go Wrong (And They Will)</h3>
                <p>Here's a very real situation you will run into — probably on your first day. You write some code. You run it. And... nothing happens. Or worse, the program refuses to run at all.</p>
                <p>At this point, many beginners immediately think: "I broke something." "I'm not smart enough for this." "Real programmers don't get stuck like this."</p>
                
                <div class="page-break">===== Page 7 =====</div>
                <p>None of that is true. What's actually happening is much simpler.</p>

                <h3>Errors, Bugs, and a Very Honest Computer</h3>
                <p>When code is written incorrectly, the computer doesn't try to fix it for you. It doesn't guess your intention. Instead, it stops and tells you: "I don't understand this."</p>
                <p>This moment is called an error. Programmers often call these problems bugs. The word sounds dramatic, but it simply means: something is wrong in the code.</p>
                <p>There is nothing mysterious about a bug. And there is nothing shameful about having one. Bugs are not signs that you are bad at coding. They are signs that the computer is doing exactly what it's supposed to do: refusing unclear instructions.</p>

            <section class="chapter">
                <h3>So What Is Debugging?</h3>
                <p>Once there is a bug, the next step is obvious. You fix it.</p>
                <p>The process of finding what went wrong and correcting it is called debugging. That's the word you hear programmers use all the time.</p>
                <p>Debugging does not mean rewriting everything from scratch. Most of the time, it means slowing down and asking simple questions:</p>
                <p>Did I misspell something?</p>
                
                <div class="page-break">===== Page 8 =====</div>
                <p>Did I forget a symbol? Did I tell the program to do things in the wrong order? Often, the mistake is small. A missing character. A wrong name. An extra line. But computers are extremely literal, so small mistakes matter.</p>

            <section class="chapter">
                <h3>Who Are You Writing Code For?</h3>
                <p>Here's something that confused me for a long time. When I first started learning to code, I thought I was writing code for myself. Or maybe for other programmers.</p>
                <p>I wasn't.</p>
                <p>You are always writing code for the computer. Other humans reading your code is a secondary concern.</p>
                <p>This explains why code sometimes looks repetitive or awkward. It's not trying to sound elegant. It's trying to be precise.</p>
                <p>Think of code as instructions you hand to a very fast, very obedient, and very literal assistant. If your instructions are clear, it will do exactly what you want. If they are vague, incomplete, or inconsistent, it will do nothing - or something completely unexpected.</p>

                <h3>What a Program Really Is</h3>
                <p>A program is simply a list of instructions, written in a specific order. That's it.</p>
                
                <div class="page-break">===== Page 9 =====</div>
                <p>Some instructions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>store information</li>
                    <li>compare values</li>
                    <li>repeat actions</li>
                    <li>make decisions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When people say, "This program does X," what they really mean is: "This program follows a series of instructions that result in X."</p>
                <p>Java programs are no different. They may look intimidating at first, but once you understand what each part is responsible for, the mystery fades quickly.</p>

            <section class="chapter">
                <h3>A First Look at a Java Program</h3>
                <p>You don't need to understand this yet. Just look at it.</p>
                
                <div class="code-block">public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}</div>
                
                <p>At first glance, this may feel overwhelming. That's normal.</p>
                <p>Right now, all you need to know is this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a complete Java program</li>
                    <li>The computer starts running from a specific place</li>
                    <li>When it runs, it prints a line of text</li>
                    <li>Nothing more.</li>

                <h3>A Quiet Truth About Programming</h3>
                <p>Here's something no one tells beginners clearly enough: Writing new code is only part of programming.</p>
                <p>A huge amount of time is spent:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>reading code</li>
                    <li>fixing code</li>
                    <li>adjusting code</li>
                    <li>debugging code</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Even experienced programmers encounter bugs every single day. The difference is not that they make fewer mistakes. It's that they are no longer afraid of them.</p>
                <p>To a programmer, an error message is not an insult. It's a clue.</p>

                <h3>Before We Move On</h3>
                <p>If you feel a little uncomfortable right now, that's okay. Discomfort at this stage does not mean you're bad at coding. It means your brain is learning how to be more precise.</p>
                <p>That skill takes time. And it takes practice.</p>
                <p>You don't need to understand everything at once. You just need to keep moving forward. And you will.</p>

            <h3>Before We Start: Getting Your Tools Ready</h3>
            <p>Before writing any code, there is one thing we need to clear up. Yes, you need tools to write Java. Yes, there are many choices. And yes, people online love arguing about them.</p>
            <p>Ignore that for now. Tools are not the skill. They are just how you access the skill.</p>
            <p>Think of it like writing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The language matters</li>
                <li>The ideas matter</li>
                <li>The pen you use matters much less</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So in this book, we will keep tools simple and practical. We'll only explain what you need when you need it.</p>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h3>Two Things You Need to Write Java</h3>
            <p>To run a Java program, you need two things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Java Development Kit (JDK)</li>
                <li>A place to write your code</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That's it.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h3>What Is the JDK?</h3>
            <p>Imagine I am traveling in Mexico. I only speak Chinese, and the locals only speak Spanish. To communicate, I need a translator.</p>
            
            <div class="page-break">===== Page 12 =====</div>
            
            <p>The JDK is that translator for your computer. Your computer does not speak Java by default.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You write instructions in Java</li>
                <li>The JDK translates them into something the computer can run</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You do not need to know how the JDK works internally. You only need to know this: If Java runs on your computer, the JDK is doing its job.</p>
            <p>Later, when you hear people casually say "make sure your JDK is set up," this is what they mean.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h3>Where Do You Write the Code?</h3>
            <p>You could technically write Java in a plain text file. But no one actually does that anymore.</p>
            <p>Instead, programmers use something called an IDE (short for Integrated Development Environment). That name sounds intimidating. In practice, an IDE is just: A program that helps you write, run, and debug code more easily.</p>
            <p>It gives you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a place to type code</li>
                <li>a button to run it</li>
                <li>helpful messages when something goes wrong</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Popular Java IDEs include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and VS Code. For this book, any of them is fine. If you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>create a Java file</li>
                <li>run it</li>
                <li>see output</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="page-break">===== Page 13 =====</div>

            <h3>Where to Go for Setup Help</h3>
            <p>If you already have Java running, you can safely skip this section. If not, here are official, reliable resources you can use. You don't need to understand everything on these pages — just follow the steps.</p>
            
            <h4>Java Development Kit (JDK)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Official Oracle JDK Downloads: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/</li>
                <li>Alternative (OpenJDK, free and widely used): https://adoptium.net/</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Look for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Java 17 (or later)</li>
                <li>The version for your operating system (Windows / macOS / Linux)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>IDE Options (Choose One)</h4>
            <p>You only need one of these.</p>

            <h3>How to Check If Everything Is Working</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Open your IDE after installation</li>
                <li>Create a new Java project (usually File → New → Project)</li>
                <li>Create a new class called Main (don't worry about what this means yet)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="page-break">===== Page 14 =====</div>
            
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Copy the Hello World code into it</li>
                <li>Click the "Run" button (usually a green triangle)</li>
                <li>If you see "Hello, world!" in the output window, you're ready!</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Common Issues & Quick Fixes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Java not found": Make sure JDK is installed, not just JRE</li>
                <li>"Class not found": Check if file is saved with .java extension</li>
                <li>Nothing happens: Look for a "Run" or "Execute" button</li>
                <li>Red error text: Read it carefully - it's telling you exactly what's wrong</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h3>A Quiet Reminder</h3>
            <p>If installation feels annoying or confusing, that's normal. Setting up tools is often the least enjoyable part of programming - even for experienced developers. Struggling here does not reflect your ability to learn Java. Once everything is set up, the learning curve becomes much smoother.</p>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h3>Your First Program: Hello, World</h3>
            <p>There is a long tradition in programming. The first program almost everyone writes prints this line: Hello, world!</p>
            <p>Here is the code again:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}</div>
            
            <div class="page-break">===== Page 15 =====</div>
            
            <h4>Where Does the Program Start?</h4>
            <p>Every Java program starts running from one specific place. That place is called:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">public static void main(String[] args)</div>
            
            <p>You do not need to understand why it looks like this yet. For now, just remember one rule: When a Java program runs, it starts at main.</p>
            <p>Nothing before it runs first. Nothing outside it runs automatically. This will make much more sense later.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h4>What Is Actually Happening Here?</h4>
            <p>Look at this line:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">System.out.println("Hello, world!");</div>
            
            <p>This line tells the computer to: Print the text "Hello, world!" to the screen.</p>
            <p>That's it.</p>
            <p>When you click Run, this happens:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Java finds main</li>
                <li>It reads the instructions inside</li>
                <li>It prints a line of text</li>
                <li>The program ends</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="page-break">===== Page 16 =====</div>
            
            <p>If you see Hello, world! appear in the output area, congratulations — you just ran a Java program. You are officially doing programming.</p>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h3>If It Doesn't Work (This Is Normal)</h3>
            <p>There is a good chance something will go wrong the first time. Maybe:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>nothing prints</li>
                <li>the program doesn't run</li>
                <li>red text appears</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This does not mean you failed. It means you are experiencing programming as it actually is.</p>
            <p>Read the message carefully. Most errors at this stage are simple:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a missing character</li>
                <li>a wrong name</li>
                <li>a file saved in the wrong place</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is where debugging begins — the process of fixing mistakes.</p>
            <p>And yes, this is exactly what professional programmers do all day.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h3>Error Messages Are Your Friends</h3>
            <p>Let's look at a real error you might see:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">error: ';' expected</div>
            
            <div class="page-break">===== Page 17 =====</div>
            
            <p>This means: Java expects a semicolon here, but didn't find one. How to fix: Check the line it mentions, and add a semicolon at the end.</p>
            
            <p>Another common one:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">error: cannot find symbol</div>
            
            <p>This means: You used a name that Java doesn't recognize. How to fix: Check your spelling.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h3>One Important Mental Shift</h3>
            <p>Here is a mindset that will help you enormously: You are not trying to write perfect code. You are trying to write clear instructions, then adjust them.</p>
            <p>Programming is a conversation:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You write something</li>
                <li>The computer responds honestly</li>
                <li>You fix what's unclear</li>
                <li>You try again</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That's it.</p>

        <section class="chapter">
            <h3>What You Should Take Away From This Chapter</h3>
            <p>By now, you should understand a few key ideas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A Java program has a clear starting point</li>
                <li>Running code is a concrete action, not a theory</li>

            <h4>A Small Exercise (Nothing Scary)</h4>
            <p>Before moving on, let's pause and do something simple. You don't need to write new code from scratch. You only need to change what already works.</p>
            
            <h5>Exercise 1: Make the Program Speak</h5>
            <p>Take your Hello, world! program and try the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Change the text inside the quotation marks</li>
                <li>Replace "Hello, world!" with your own message</li>
                <li>For example: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Hello, Java!"</li>
                        <li>"My first program is running."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Run the program again.</li>
                <li>Did the output change?</li>
                <li>If not, check carefully what you edited.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This small change proves something important:
